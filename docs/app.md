#### Graph Coloring

When it comes to node coloring you start by coloring all nodes differently. With more nodes and a limited number of distinguishable colors, nodes will get grouped by type or tag. Finally, groups can be assigned by computations (e.g. k-means clustering, cos-similarity, etc.) where sub groups can be assigned a different hue of the groups base color or the similarity space can be mapped to a color palette.
